## Stanford's Customizable AI Tool Speeds Up Pathologist Workflows
A new AI tool developed at Stanford Medicine, called nuclei.io, helps pathologists identify diseased cells in biopsies and blood samples more quickly and accurately. Unlike other AI tools, nuclei.io is customizable, allowing each pathologist to personalize its training to their specific workflow and preferences. This makes it a more powerful and flexible tool than the one-size-fits-all AI programs currently available.
In trials, Stanford pathologists using nuclei.io were able to make diagnoses up to 62% faster and 72% more accurately than without the program. The AI tool does not replace pathologists, but instead acts as a powerful assistant, highlighting potential areas of interest and reducing the time spent searching for diseased cells.
The team believes this personalized AI tool could help address the growing shortage of pathologists while also improving the accuracy and speed of diagnoses, ultimately benefiting patients. nuclei.io is currently being tested for its ability to identify different types of diseased cells and is being prepared for wider deployment across Stanford Medicine and beyond.
