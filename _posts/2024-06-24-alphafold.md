## AlphaFold 3: A Game Changer for Biology and Medicine

AlphaFold 3 (AF3) is a groundbreaking AI model that has revolutionized the field of biomolecular structure prediction. This powerful tool, built on the success of its predecessor AlphaFold 2, can now accurately predict the 3D structures of complex systems involving proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules, ions, and even modified residues. AF3 surpasses specialized tools for each individual complex type, demonstrating its remarkable ability to handle a wide range of biomolecular interactions within a single unified framework. This advancement holds immense promise for accelerating research in drug discovery, protein engineering, and understanding the complex workings of the cell.
