## Title AI for Healthcare: A Guide to Trustworthy and Ethical Implementation

The CHAI Assurance Standards Guide provides a comprehensive framework for developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems in healthcare. This guide, developed by a collaborative group of patient advocates, technology developers, clinicians, and data scientists, is designed for stakeholders involved in every aspect of the AI lifecycle.
This document emphasizes six core principles for trustworthy health AI: usefulness, fairness, safety, transparency, security, and privacy. It outlines practical considerations for each principle, focusing on real-world use cases. The guide also stresses the importance of independent reviews and the need for clear governance structures within organizations using AI.
By applying these standards, healthcare organizations can ensure that AI solutions are safe, effective, and equitable, ultimately improving patient care and healthcare outcomes.
