## Is AI the Future of NSTEMI Care? Explore the Potential of Predictive Analytics
This article explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing the diagnosis and risk assessment of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It highlights the MI³ algorithm, a gradient boosting AI model that provides rapid diagnosis in emergency settings, surpassing traditional methods in accuracy. However, the article acknowledges limitations of MI³, including its reliance on a single algorithm and lack of explainable AI. It proposes solutions, such as using explainable AI techniques and stacked ensemble learning, to address these limitations and improve model transparency and generalizability. The article emphasizes the need for continued research and development to ensure AI algorithms are readily accessible, integrated into clinical practice, and ethically sound.
