## Large Language Models for Patient Messaging: Efficiency Gains & Safety Concerns

This study investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) to draft responses to patient messages in a cancer care setting. The research found that LLMs can significantly reduce physician workload and improve response consistency. However, the study also highlighted potential risks associated with LLM-generated responses, particularly in accurately assessing and communicating the acuity of patient scenarios. This suggests the need for careful evaluation and monitoring of LLMs in clinical settings, ensuring they are used safely and effectively to enhance patient care.
